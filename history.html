                <p>
                    Wushu (simplified Chinese: 武术; traditional Chinese: 武術) is both an exhibition and a full-contact sport
                    derived from traditional Chinese martial arts. It was developed in China after 1949, in an effort to standardize
                    the practice of traditional Chinese martial arts, although attempts to structure the various decentralized
                    martial arts traditions date back earlier, when the Central Guoshu Institute was established at Nanking in 1928.
                    The term wushu is Chinese for "martial arts" (武 "Wu" = military or martial, 术 "Shu" = art). In contemporary
                    times, wushu has become an international sport through the International Wushu Federation (IWUF), which holds the
                    World Wushu Championships every two years; the first World Championships were held in 1991 in Beijing and won by
                    Yuan Wen Qing.

                    Noticing the small, fragmented nature of wushu clubs in Seattle, the founders of the club, a collection of
                    prominent local wushu teachers, established the club in order to showcase the beauty and art of wushu.
                    By establishing a collegiate group, the founders sought to develop an environment tailored to the transmission
                    of wushu knowledge, allowing people with similar interests to connect and guide the development of wushu in Seattle.

                <h2>
                    Accolades
                </h2>
                <p>wushu practice at the UW has largely been an underground thing, only known about by a few dedicated
                    practitioners. the yue fei wushu club was the earliest known group to practice wushu at UW. the members
                    were
                    experienced and learned wushu from prominent local teachers like hong yijao, former zhejiang wushu team
                    member;
                    mark jackson, former british national team member; and michael li.
                    at their height in 2004, they had as many as 20 members practicing at the IMA. but they never became
                    official,
                    and major obstacles caused the group to eventually dissipate to just a few dedicated athletes.</p>

                <p>the next UW wushu group was another unofficial fledgling group that represented the small wushu
                    population in
                    seattle. weekly practices rarely had more than 3 people, but this routine set the stage for the creation
                    of the
                    current wushu club
                    as the group gained more interested practitioners and participated at several large performances and
                    competed at
                    tournaments.
                </p>

                <p>we are now a larger group that practices regularly at the IMA.
                    we also regularly perform for UW student organizations and also many
                    other non-UW organizations within seattle. we also compete at the
                    annual collegiates competition against other universities, along with the
                    annual CMAT competition at UC Berkeley, the largest chinese
                    martial arts competition in the the United States.

                    Hopes and Dreams
                </h2>
                <p>

                <p>we made our debut at the 16th Annual Chinese Martial Arts Tournament hosted by UC Berkeley. freshman
                    priscilla
                    dang won 3rd place in the women's advanced longfist division and 1st in advanced other weapon. junior
                    and team
                    captain travis dang won 1st place in the men's advanced longfist division. we'll be back next year for
                    more
                    medals.

                </p>

                <p>not only do we practice wushu, we teach a children's wushu class at chinese school on saturdays. it's a
                    chance
                    for us to spread interest in wushu even farther, inspire the next generation of wushu athletes, and give
                    back to
                    the community.
                </p>

                <p>in the future, we hope to become a club sport at UW, offer formal wushu classes coached by li tianyuan,
                    and
                    become a contributing part to the development of US wushu. currently, we're working on our fundamentals,
                    the
                    basic techniques and conditioning,
                    getting our team organized for upcoming demos and performances, and having fun at the same time.
